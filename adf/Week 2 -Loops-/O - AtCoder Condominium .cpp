 * at first we need to declare three integer variables one of them for number of floors (n) , and the second one for the number of rooms (k),
 * and the third one will be a counter and will be intialized with 0 (sum) .
 * get the numbers (n) and (k).
 *
 * we can implement any type of loops ( while , for , do while ) 
 * and for the following operation we need to impelment nested loop.
 *
 * make an interval for the outer loop from one to the given number of floors (1:(n)) ,
 *   and in the inner loop make an interval from one to the given number of rooms (1:(k))  .
 *   in the body of the inner loop we will multiply (i) by 100 and add (j) to the result .
 *   at the end of every iteration add the final result to the sum variable (sum).
 * finally, print the value of (sum).
