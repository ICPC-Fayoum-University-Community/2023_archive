 * at first we need to declare three integer variables one
 * of them for Limka whight (a), and the second one for wight of (Bob), and the third one will be an counter and will be intialized to 0 .
 * get the numbers (a) and (b).
 *
 * we can implement any type of loops ( while , for , do while ) for the following operation.
 *
 * make a condition for the loop while (a) isn't greater than (b) (a <= b).
 *
 * in the body of the loop we will multiply (a) by 3 , (b) by 2 and we will increase the counter by one . 
 * at the end of the loop print the final number of iterations.
 * Prepared By: Ahmed Mohsen (group 8).
