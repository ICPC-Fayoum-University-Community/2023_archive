 * get the numbers (r) , (d) and (x).
 *
 * we can implement any type of loops ( while , for , do while ) for the following operation.
 * make a condition for the loop from one to the number of operations ( 1 : 10 ).
 *
 * in the body of the loop we will update the value of (x) by the given formula x[i+1] = (r*x[i])-d .
 * and now print the current value of x at the end of the finished iteration in a single line.
