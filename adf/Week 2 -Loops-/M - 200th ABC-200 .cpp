 * at first we need to declare two long long variables one of them to take the number (N), and the other one for number of operations (K).
 * get the number (N) and the number of operations (K).
 * we can implement any type of loops ( while , for , do while ) for the following operation.
 * make a condition for the loop from one to the number of operations ( 1 : (K) ).
 * in the body of the loop if the number is multiple of 200 we will divide it by 200, else we will multiply it by 1000 then add 200 to it .
 * at the end of this process we should have the final value of (N).
 * Prepared By: Ahmed Mohsen (group 8).
